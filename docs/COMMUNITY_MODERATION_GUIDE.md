| **Harassment** | Bullying, threats, personal attacks | Hide post, warn user |
| **Hate Speech** | Discrimination, slurs, bigotry | Hide immediately |

### Reviewing Reports

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Read the Report**
   - Review the reporter's reason and description
   - Note the report type and timestamp
   - Check if multiple users reported the same content

2. **Examine the Content**
   - View the reported post or comment
   - Read full context (thread, replies)
   - Consider author's intent and community impact

3. **Check Guidelines**
   - Does it violate community standards?
   - Is it potentially harmful?
   - Could it be educational if context is added?

4. **Make a Decision**
   - **Mark Valid** - Violation confirmed, action taken
   - **Mark Invalid** - No violation, content restored

5. **Take Action** (if valid)
   - Blur for mild violations
   - Hide for serious violations
   - Restore if mistakenly flagged

### Automatic Actions

SafeVoice has built-in thresholds:

| Reports | Automatic Action | Your Role |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **3 reports** | Content blurred | Review within 24h |
| **5 reports** | Post hidden | Confirm or restore |
| **10 reports** | Post deleted | Investigation required |

**Important:** Always review automatically-actioned content. False reporting does happen.

### Valid Report Workflow

When you mark a report as **Valid**:

1. **Post is hidden** (if not already)
2. **Reporter earns +10 VOICE** (encourages good reporting)
3. **You earn +30 VOICE** (moderator action reward)
4. **Notification sent** to reporter confirming validation
5. **Post status updated** to "Hidden by moderator"

### Invalid Report Workflow

When you mark a report as **Invalid**:

1. **Content is restored** (blur/hide removed)
2. **Reporter loses -5 VOICE** (discourages false reports)
3. **You earn +30 VOICE** (moderator action reward)
4. **Notification sent** to reporter explaining decision
5. **Post returns to normal visibility**

## Moderator Rewards

### Earning VOICE Tokens

| Action | Reward | Cooldown | Notes |

| Verify advice | 30 VOICE | 5 min | Moderator action |
| Restore post | 30 VOICE | 5 min | Moderator action |

Your moderation rewards appear in:
- Transaction history (Wallet section)
- Earnings breakdown (bonuses category)
- Moderator panel (action count)

---

## Best Practices

### Decision-Making Framework

**For every moderation decision, ask:**

1. **Is it harmful?** - Could it hurt someone?
2. **Is it a violation?** - Clear guideline breach?
3. **Is context important?** - Does situation matter?
4. **Is action proportionate?** - Fitting response?
5. **Is it reversible?** - Can I undo if wrong?

### Communication Guidelines

**When commenting as moderator:**
- ✅ Be clear and specific
- ✅ Explain your reasoning
- ✅ Provide resources when relevant
- ✅ Maintain professional tone
- ❌ Don't be condescending
- ❌ Don't engage in arguments
- ❌ Don't make it personal

### Bias Awareness

**Watch for unconscious bias:**
- Treatment based on posting history
- Assumptions about user intent
- Different standards for different topics
- Personal triggers influencing decisions

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Review guidelines before each decision
- Take breaks during difficult content
- Consult other moderators when uncertain
- Document reasoning for transparency

### Self-Care

Moderating can be emotionally draining:

- 🧘 **Take regular breaks** - Step away between reviews
- 🗣️ **Debrief with peers** - Talk to other moderators
- 🚫 **Know your limits** - Skip content that triggers you
- 🛌 **Rest adequately** - Don't moderate while tired
- 💙 **Seek support** - Use crisis resources yourself if needed
