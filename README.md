## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v3
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## 🏃 Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🏗️ Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

## 🚢 Deployment

SafeVoice is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

- **Production URL**: https://safevoice009.github.io/Safevoice-cto/
- **Base path**: `/Safevoice-cto/`
- **Workflow**: [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

### Triggering a Deploy

1. Merge or push changes to the `main` branch.
2. The GitHub Actions workflow installs dependencies with `npm ci`, runs `npm run build`, and publishes the generated `dist/` output to the GitHub Pages environment.
3. The published site automatically serves the latest build from the `gh-pages` branch managed by GitHub Pages.

### Local Verification

1. Run `npm run build` to generate the production bundle.
2. Run `npm run preview` to review the build locally at `http://localhost:4173/Safevoice-cto/`.
3. Verify that deep links (for example `/feed`, `/marketplace`) work locally. The production deployment includes a `public/404.html` fallback so client-side routes resolve correctly on GitHub Pages.

## 🪙 Reward Engine & Token Economy

### $VOICE Token (ERC20)

The `VoiceToken` smart contract powers SafeVoice's on-chain token economy:

- **Supply Cap**: 1 billion tokens maximum
- **Access Control**: Role-based minting, burning, and bridge operations
- **EIP-2612 Permit**: Gasless approvals for better UX
- **Emergency Pause**: Admin-controlled pause for security incidents
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Support for multi-chain deployments

See [VOICE_TOKEN_API.md](./docs/VOICE_TOKEN_API.md) for complete contract documentation.

### VoiceVesting Module

The on-chain vesting coordinator allocates the fixed 1B VOICE supply across four governance-approved tranches with cliff and linear vesting support. A 48-hour timelock guards beneficiary changes and the contract can be paused during incidents.

| Tranche | Allocation | Percent | Vesting Profile |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Community Rewards | 400,000,000 VOICE | 40% | Linear release over 24 months (no cliff) |
| Treasury | 250,000,000 VOICE | 25% | Linear release over 60 months |
| Team | 200,000,000 VOICE | 20% | 12-month cliff, 48-month linear vesting |
| Ecosystem | 150,000,000 VOICE | 15% | 6-month cliff, 36-month linear vesting |

Key analytics touchpoints:
- `VestingScheduleCreated` for newly provisioned allocations and beneficiary onboarding metrics
- `TokensReleased` to track realized supply circulation and cohort unlocks
- `VestingRevoked` to monitor clawbacks and compliance-driven actions
- `BeneficiaryUpdated` for governance-approved handoffs or wallet rotations

Integration teams can pull the ABI via `npm run export:abis` and access full usage guidelines in [VESTING_MODULE.md](./docs/VESTING_MODULE.md).

### Staking & Governance

The on-chain staking and governance system enables VOICE token holders to:

- **Stake VOICE tokens** with configurable lock periods to earn rewards
- **Participate in on-chain governance** via snapshot-based voting
- **Delegate voting power** to trusted representatives
- **Earn staking rewards** with transparent APY calculation

#### Key Contracts

- **VoiceStaking**: Manages stake positions, reward accrual, and emergency withdrawals
- **VoiceVotingToken** (vVOICE): Non-transferable governance token minted 1:1 on stake
- **VoiceGovernor**: OpenZeppelin Governor for proposal creation, voting, and execution

#### Staking Features

- **Lock Periods**: 7 days minimum, 365 days maximum (configurable per chain)
- **Early Unstake Penalty**: 10% default (configurable up to 50%)
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: 2-day delay mechanism for security
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Chain-specific parameters and emission schedules
- **RewardEngine Integration**: Transparent APY calculation surfaced in UI

See [STAKING_GOVERNANCE_DOCS.md](./STAKING_GOVERNANCE_DOCS.md) for complete documentation.

### RewardEngine & Web3 Bridge

The `RewardEngine` centralizes all $VOICE token state and lives in [`src/lib/tokens/RewardEngine.ts`](src/lib/tokens/RewardEngine.ts). Beginning with v2.1 the engine can transparently bridge rewards and spending actions to on-chain smart contracts via the `Web3Bridge` service.

#### Core Responsibilities (Offline-First)
- Persist wallet state (balances, pending rewards, streak data, transactions) under the `voice_wallet_snapshot` key in `localStorage`.
- Migrate legacy `voice*` keys on first run and guard subsequent migrations with the `voice_migration_v1` flag.
- Emit callbacks for reward/spend/balance changes and fire toast notifications to keep UI consumers synchronized.
- Calculate post rewards, daily bonuses, streak milestones, premium subscriptions, and achievement unlocks consistently across the app.

#### Web3 Bridge Integration
- When `VITE_WEB3_ENABLED=true`, the engine delegates claims, burns, staking deposits, withdrawals, vote submissions, and NFT unlocks to the on-chain contracts exposed via the `Web3Bridge`.
- Transactions are queued optimistically, immediately updating the UI while a background poller waits for confirmations.
- Failed on-chain transactions automatically trigger rollbacks that restore pending balances, remove optimistic history entries, and display reconciliation toasts.
- The bridge tracks pending receipts per chain, supports multi-chain RPC configuration, and persists queued transactions so browser refreshes do not lose state.
- See [`docs/WEB3_BRIDGE_DOCS.md`](./docs/WEB3_BRIDGE_DOCS.md) for the full API and integration guide.

### Achievement NFTs (ERC1155)

Milestone achievements and community recognitions are minted through the on-chain [`VoiceAchievementNFT`](./contracts/src/VoiceAchievementNFT.sol) contract. The collection is designed for large-scale reward drops while supporting unique badges and soulbound tiers.

Key capabilities:
- **Role-Gated Minting** – RewardEngine and bridge adapters operate behind dedicated MINTER and BRIDGE roles
- **Soulbound Achievements** – Legendary tiers can be locked to wallets while everyday badges remain transferable
- **Metadata Flexibility** – Hierarchical base URIs with per-chain overrides and token-specific IPFS links
- **Bridge Hooks** – `bridgeTransfer`/`bridgeReceive` enable cross-chain portability for non-soulbound tiers
- **Batch Operations** – `mintBatch` and `airdrop` keep gas costs low for large cohorts

Frontend teams can hydrate achievement tiles by calling `uri(tokenId)` and `balanceOfBatch`, then fetching the returned JSON metadata. A full integration cookbook, including tier taxonomy, sample UI components, and notification flows, lives in [docs/NFT_REWARDS_DOCS.md](./docs/NFT_REWARDS_DOCS.md).

### Hardhat & Smart Contract Tooling

Smart contract tooling now lives in the `contracts/` workspace and can be driven from the project root:

```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run hardhat:compile

# Run Hardhat unit tests
npm run test:contracts

# Lint Solidity sources with Solhint
npm run lint:contracts

# Run coverage with threshold enforcement
npm run coverage:contracts

# Deploy tagged deployments (uses hardhat-deploy)
npm run deploy:voice

# Run gas benchmarking with thresholds
npm run security:gas
```

> **Note:** Hardhat tasks rely on the placeholder `SafeVoiceVault` contract. Replace with production contracts before mainnet deployment and update thresholds accordingly. See [`contracts/README.md`](./contracts/README.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the new setup, environment variables, and deployment instructions.
